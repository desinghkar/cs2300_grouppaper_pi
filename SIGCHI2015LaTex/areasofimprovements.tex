\section{Areas of Improvements}

Some ways that this assignment might be improved in the future and yield better results might include some of the following:
\subsection{Running a longer experiment}
Running the experiment for a longer period of time would help eliminate the small outliers that had a great impact on the dataset due to the short amount of the experiment. This would also allow for less biases to be introduced depending on the amount of time. For example this could eliminate temporal biases such as seasons or other factors such as a big event etc. 
\subsection{Advice during design phase}
While participants read and discussed on the topic of personal informatics there was
little information about how and what decisions need to be made when planning an experiment design. Even when participants chose their variables there was little feedback on whether or not they would make for a good experiment. A higher degree of planning before starting the experiment might have even accounted for some of the confounding factors observed during the experiment. 
\subsection{Background in statistics}
    Although many students stated they had some background in statistics it would also be helpful to have had a lesson on what type of statistical tests to run on the different types of datasets and how to perform these correctly. A more structured run-through of how to do a N=1 experiment and how to run analysis would have benefited many of the participants.
