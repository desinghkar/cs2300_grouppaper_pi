\begin{abstract}
Personal informatics experimentation is a growing area of research used for self-exploration. There are many ways to run personal informatics experiments, some more scientifically rigorous than others, and there is no template for how these experiments should be constructed. In this study, we had 21 students in a graduate level computer science course run a personal informatics experiment on themselves for a month, tracking at least two variables to see if there would be any significant changes. These students had a brief overview of standard research practices and some, but not all, had statistical backgrounds to better analyze their data. Each student ran their experiment differently, in a way that fit in with their day to day life. At the end of the experiment, a variety of statistical tests were used to evaluate the data. 
\\
We find that personal informatics experiments are best left up to individuals to tweak and tailor to meet their demands. Users should design these studies specific to their needs. Since everyone lives differently, there is no set formula for how these kinds of studies should be run. In designing their experiments, we found that it was helpful to have a long enough time to run the experiment; use technologies that automatically track variables; and have some sort of background in statistics to find statistically meaningful results.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:

% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-

% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
